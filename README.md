# Matthew Ubalde's Portfolio Website

Hello! This is my portfolio website made with Astro.js, Vue.js, and Tailwind.

I'm a student at Fanshawe College in their Computer Programming and Analysis program.

All of my experience in the coding industry can be found here. I'll keep my best to update this time-to-time, as I'm constantly learning new things.

Currently looking for an internship position!

## Why use Astro?

Originally, I was using React, and then Gatsby. But I found them to bloated, and hard to work with at times.

Using only React was very limiting, and Gatsby's was slow whenever changes are made. I ended up research for other alternatives and found Astro instead.

The great thing about Astro is that it's framework agnostic. If there's any other advancements in the JS world, I can adapt to it without making any big changes on my code-base.

It also has better content-collection tools than Gatsby, and far more easier to use.
