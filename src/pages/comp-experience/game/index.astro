      <p>
        Was taught on how to use the Unity Engine, but developed games as a
        side-hobby with Godot. This is purely as an interest, but willing to try
        to break into this industry when given the opportunity.

      <h1>Games for Fun</h1>
      <p>
        These are purely made out of fun as I found the game development
        interesting since I was really young. I like making games that are
        simple, but tried to make it deep and rewarding at the same time.
