      <p>
        Was taught on how to use the Unity Engine, but developed games as a
        side-hobby with Godot. This is purely as an interest, but willing to try
        to break into this industry when given the opportunity.

      These are purely made out of fun as I found the game development
      interesting since I was really young. I like making games that are simple,
      but tried to make it deep and rewarding at the same time.
