    <h1>King of the Cheese</h1>
    <p>
      King of the Hat fan-game where you play as Dark Birthday and eat cheese in
      his dreams! There's no win condition, and simply a fun game where you eat
      cheese!
    </p>
    <p>
      The engine is made in Godot. And all of the design, art, sounds, and music
      are made by me.
    </p>
    <p>King of the Hat is rightfully owned by Hat Games</p>

    <h1>How it was created</h1>
    <div class="flex justify-center items-center gap-8">
      <p>
        It was inspired from a small joke within the community to make Dark
        Birthday canonically eats cheese.
      </p>
      <div class="flex flex-col justify-center items-end gap-2">

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Since I liked the idea so much, I thought it would be cute to make a game
      out of it!

    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p>
      While the game's core gameplay is complete, there are a few things I've
      noticed
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It's not very satisfying.</li>
      <li>There's no sense of direction.</li>
      <li>Lacking in charm and character.</li>
      <li>Not worth playing it in longer duration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To make the game more fun, I tried solving them by adding better feedback,
      animations, and polish, with some easter eggs and quality-of-life changes.
    </p>
  </Section>
  <Section defaultFlex>
    <h1>Feedback and Graphics</h1>
    <p>
      In general, I polish the animations, added running particles, and among
      other things.
    </p>
    <!-- <ComparisonContainer>
      <Fragment slot="before"> </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="after"> </Fragment>
    </ComparisonContainer> -->
    <p>
      Whenever you press Z/X/Spacebar near cheese, you eat them instantly!
      Running through thousands of them would be more satisfying if there was
      more feedback with better sounds and visuals.
    </p>
    <!-- <ComparisonContainer>
      <Fragment slot="before"> </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="after"> </Fragment>
    </ComparisonContainer> -->
    <p>
      And then, I thought about having hundreds and thousands of cheese and
      eating them would be really fun! But for that to happen, I needed to the
      cheeses themselves
    </p>
  </Section>
  <Section defaultFlex>
    <h1>Optimizations</h1>
    <p>One of the most notable optimization is the audio.</p>
    <p>
      In Godot, there's a separate audio thread which became a bottleneck when
      there's thousands of cheeses in the scene. This is because creating
      thousands of them also creates the audio object
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the audio can only be heard when the player is near by, I thought it
      would be better to only create the audio object and attaching it to the
      cheese when it's only needed. Freeing up the audio thread which in turn
      more performance.
    </p>
    <!-- <ComparisonContainer>
      <Fragment slot="before"> </Fragment>
      <Fragment slot="after"> </Fragment>
    </ComparisonContainer> -->
    <p>
      Among other optimizations such as using the VisibleNotifier2D and reducing
      unneeded code, it's possible to have more cheeses all in the screen! More
      so 10 000 cheeses compare to the 1 000 that would cause some lag.

    <h1>Easter Eggs</h1>
    <p>
      To help engage the player a bit, I added easter eggs! Some were from the
      community and some friends. Just small additions for the player to explore
      and such.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a few instances of easter eggs appearing randomly like Dark
      Birthday becoming Birthday, or the Hint Provider!
    </p>
    <h2>Hint Provider</h2>
    <p>INSERT IMG</p>
    <p>
      The Hint Provider not only helps the player to remind and inform the
      controls and other quality-of-life features, but also have random and
      funny hints.
    </p>
    <p>
      While small, it does help provide rettention while playing as it gives the
      player something rewarding while playing a bit further.
    </p>
    <h2>Secret Ending</h2>
    <p>INSERT IMG</p>
    <p>
      The Secret Ending activated with the 24 (the day they canonically made
      Dark Birthday love cheese) cheese maximum, and has "No Limits" enabled.
      Just something for the player can go for if they have nothing else to do.
    </p>
    <p>INSERT IMG</p>
    <p>
      Due to the violently shaking camera, and gradual zooming, it's became a
      challenge for the player to find the cheeses to continue and complete the
      ending.
    </p>
    <p>INSERT VID</p>
    <p>
      And if the player accidentally found this out and doesn't want to, they
      can just wait for a bit and will quickly revert back to the original
      state.
    </p>
  </Section>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      All of these things adds up together in this small and short experience.
      None of them detach from the core experience, and it's there for the
      player to discover and enjoy!
    </p>
    <p>
      While I could add more things to the project, I have to stop and consider
      if it's worth working even further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the last update, only a few people ever played on it, but got the
      developers thrilled when they saw this.
    </p>
    <p>In the end, it was worth it.</p>
