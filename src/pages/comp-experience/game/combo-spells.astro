    <h1>Combo Spells</h1>
    <p>
      Play as a magician and use a combination of keys to construct bolders,
      lightning, and other elements to synergize and get the highest score
      possible!
    </p>
    <p>Originally a highschool Java final project, but was updated overtime.</p>

    <h1>School Project</h1>
    <p>
      Java is actually my first programming language I learned back in Montcalm,
      and I realized how fun and really easy it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Combo Spells was meant to be small project, but I slowly refined because
      of how fun the concept it was to me.

    <h1>Game Design</h1>
    <p>INSERT ORIGINAL DESIGN</p>
    <p>
      Originally, I wanted to create a platform fighter, however, I don't know a
      lot of physics or know if it's even possible in my skill level. To
      simplify it, I made the game it is now: you hit the dummy with spells and
      get a high score!
    </p>
    <p>
      My inspiration for the game was Tekken, and King of the Hat. A game with
      mechanical depth, and keeping it simple.
    </p>
  </Section>
  <Section defaultFlex>
    <h2>Controls</h2>
    <p>
      Motion Inputs is something I don't know how to create. And I don't want to
      clutter the controls with a dedicated button for each spell.
    </p>
    <p>
      I created a workaround by letting the user press a combination of keys in
      their own pace, and release the spell when they want to. It made the game
      simplier to play and to develop.
    </p>
    <p>INSERT SOMETHING</p>
    <p>
      However... Looking back, I'm not happy with how the controls were.
      Requiring two hands for movement and doing the inputs.
    </p>
    <p>INSERT CONTROL SCHEME</p>
    <p>It's unnecessarily complicated.</p>

    <h2>Spell Synergy with Statuses</h2>
    <p>
      To make the game more interesting, I decided to have spells inflict status
      effects and synergize with others for greater damage.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Water increases the Lightning damage, but decreases Fireball damage.
      </li>
      <li>Burn and Poison does damage overtime.</li>
      <li>Burn also increases Overgrowth damage.</li>
      <li>Stun increases the Fireball and Water Blast damage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      It creates a puzzle element for the player to solve to get a higher damage
      amount for those interested for a challenge.
    </p>

    <h1>General Improvements</h1>
    <p>
      The graphics used in this game is hard-coded with the JFrame graphic
      package provided by my high-school teacher. Each character, projectiles,
      and some of the environment are made by hand.
    </p>
    <p>INSERT OF CHAR</p>
    <p>INSERT CODE FOR CHAR</p>
    <p>
      And from the oldest version and to the latest, I say I did a pretty good
      job!

    <p>The other parts, such as the grass...</p>
    <p>INSERT IMG</p>
    <p>And clouds as well!</p>

    <h1>Struggles</h1>
    <p>
      I didn't know how classes and objects were in programming. Or even how the
      ArrayList works in Java. Majority of the data and variables were laid out
      in one single GUI class.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the graphics, logic, controls, are held into one file with the
      other two as main and keyboard listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the unnecessary complications, I made a debugger menu on the side
      if you press "I" and extend the window to the left.
    </p>
    <p>INSERT DEBUG MENU</p>
    <p>
      You can see each individual variables, and even the arrays for each
      object's property.
    </p>
    <p>
      While a mess, I tried my best to keep things neatly organized and comment
      out everything. (I lost the source code, so no examples of it)
    </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      From a 3 week highschool project with 3 months worth of updates, I was
      able to create something that I'm proud of even to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to remake the project with better backend, better controls,
      graphics, and more friendlier game design. Turning this high-score game
      into the fighting game I envisioned when I was young.
