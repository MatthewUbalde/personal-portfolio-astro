    <h1>Fanshawe College 2019-2024</h1>
    <p>
      I was new to programming, but I had incredibly fun at my programming
      course back in high-school. Throughout my experience in Fanshawe, I've
      learned a lot and created a solid and firm understanding of computers and
      programming. I'm able to learn other programming languages fairly quickly,
      and able to create applications in web, mobile, and desktop.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not an expert, but learning these technologies are fun and
      interesting, and I would love to get into the tech industry to improve my
      skills and help to create applications in need.
