    <h1>Experiences in Fanshawe</h1>
    <p>
      Was taught on the front-end with <b>Vue.js</b>, <b>React</b>, and <b
        >Angular</b
      >. And in the back-end, I was taught with <b>ASP.NET with C#</b> and <b
        >Java Spring Beans</b
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was able to create a full-stack application and was able to host it on
      <b>AWS</b> with their <b>EC2</b> service.

      <h1 class="text-center">What's this Website's Framework</h1>
      <p>
        This website made with <b>Astro</b>, <b>Vue.js</b>, and <b>Tailwind</b>.
        Currently hosted in <b>Github</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, my portfolio was purely made in <b>React</b> and <b
          >Tailwind</b
        >. However, I wanted to try another framework that I haven't tried yet
        that might be better for my own use case.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've tried with Gatsby with React for content collections, but found a
        simplier and better approach with Astro.

      <h2>Other websites?</h2>

        I've made a couple of websites with Astro for personal projects and made
        success with it. Which can be found here...
