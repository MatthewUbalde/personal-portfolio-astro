      Can create SPA with React and Vue. Used Astro to create this portfolio

      <p>
        My original portfolio site was made in <b>Vite</b> and <b>React</b>.
        After learning web development overtime, I realized I don't need React
        as a lot of JavaScript on this site is rather excessive.
      </p>
      <p>So before choosing Gatsby with React, I found myself using Astro!</p>
      <p>
        And so, I started development on this site along side Tailwind to hasten
        the development.
