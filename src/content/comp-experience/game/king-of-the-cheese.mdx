# A Fan-game for King of the Hat

A fan-game created for _King of the Hat_ (owned by Hat Games) where you play as Dark Birthday and eat cheese in his dreams!

There's no win condition as you can only eat cheese in this game!

It's made in Godot, and I make all the design, art, sounds, and music.

It was inspired by a small joke within the community to make Dark Birthday canonically eat cheese. I liked the idea so much that I thought it would be cute to make a game out of it!
